# Pragmatic Rust for Engineers

This repository contains the code for the video tutorials series **Pragmatic Rust for Engineers** by Janus IT and friends. The series teaches
Rust programming and/or to solve engineering problems. Therefore the series addresses two audiences:

1. Rust Programming Learners from Engineering disciplines such as Chemical Engineering, Electric Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, etc.
2. Software Developers who want to apply Rust to tackle engineering problems or/and use Rust in scientific environments.

In the first part of the series we will investigate the Haber-Bosch process for Ammonia production. Haber-Bosch consumes 1.1% of the world's energy supply,
and is responsible for 1.8% of the world's CO2 emissions. First, we will concentrate on simulating the reaction a long a plug flow reactor, then add some
plots to visualize our results and we conclude with some interaction via Web Assembly.

## How to Learn with Pragmatic Rust for Engineers

Pragmatic Rust for Engineers is a video series that teaches programming by applied coding on (simplified) engineering problems. We propose four different learning strategies but it's up to you to choose what suits you best.

1. Just watch the Video
    - **difficulty: story-mode** - An entertaining time, lean back and learn something.
2. Investigate the Solutions Source Code 
    - **difficulty: easy** - An intense time, dig into the code and make sense out of it.
3. Code yourself supported with hints 
    - **difficulty: medium** - An adventure with helpful NPCs scatter around the source files. 
4. Code yourself only based on an implementation plan 
    - **difficulty hard** - A threatening adventure you're only friends are your keyboard and mouse.

For working wiht 4,3 or 2 you have to use git as version control system. For each task of the series you'll find three corresponding ordered commits:

- `task: task desc` - Contains the implementation plan and task description as markdown file.
- `hint: task desc` - Contains some code and hints that show how tasks can be achieved in Rust programming.
- `solu: task desc` - Contains the solution of the task at the end of the video (probably with some additional documentation)
